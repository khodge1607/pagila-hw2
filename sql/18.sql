 * Compute the total revenue for each film.
 * The output should include another new column "revenue percent" that shows the percent of total revenue that comes from the current film and all previous films.
 * That is, the "revenue percent" column is 100*"total revenue"/sum(revenue)

 * HINT:
 * The `to_char` function can be used to achieve the correct formatting of your percentage.
